        <ol class="h2style">
            <li> Mosfellsbær</li>
            <p><b>Best for a quiet escape near Reykjavík</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Reykjavík’s friendly rural neighbor is Mosfellsbær. Its biggest attractions are the small mountains that
                surround the town, including Úlfarsfell, Mosfell, Helgafell and Reykjafell – all great for short hikes.
                Lake
                Hafravatn is a gem that locals flock to for swimming and kayaking fun. Time your visit to coincide with
                the
                popular vegetable market that carries the produce of local farmers, open every Saturday in late summer
                in the
                valley.

            <li>Flúðir</li>
            <p><b>Best base on the Golden Circle </b></p>
            <p>In rural South Iceland lies Flúðir, best known for its mushroom greenhouse. If mushrooms are your thing,
                the greenhouse’s bistro offers all things funghi related. Continue your gastronomic adventure and try
                authentic Ethiopian food at Minilik. Nearby is the Secret Lagoon, known locally as Gamla Laugin, and
                Hrunalaug, a small natural pool with stacked stone walls in the peaceful countryside. Flúðir is on the
                Golden Circle with some of the country’s best-known attractions within reach – it’s the perfect base for
                exploring the region.</p>
