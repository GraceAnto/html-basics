        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>
            Pat the chicken dry. Season all over with 1 teaspoon salt.
            Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Once the oil is glistening, add the chicken and cook about
            5 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
            Add the garlic to the same skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in heavy cream, chicken
            stock, bouillon, ¼ cup of the parmesan cheese, sun dried tomatoes, Italian seasoning, pepper, ¼ teaspoon red
            pepper flakes, and remaining salt until fully combined.
            Return the chicken to the skillet. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium low. Cook
            until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes
            more.
            Top chicken with basil, remaining Parmesan cheese, and remaining red pepper flakes and serve over pasta or
            mashed potatoes, if desired.
